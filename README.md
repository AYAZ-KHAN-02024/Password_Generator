# Password Generator

This simple JavaScript password generator creates a random password consisting of four parts: lowercase letters, uppercase letters, special characters, and a digit. The generated password is displayed in an input field, and users can easily copy it to their clipboard by clicking on an icon.

## How it works

1. The generator utilizes JavaScript to create a random password.
2. It concatenates characters from the following character sets:
   - Lowercase letters: `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz`
   - Uppercase letters: `ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ`
   - Special characters: `!*#@?%$&`
   - Digits: 0-9
3. The password is generated by randomly selecting characters from each set and combining them into a single string.
4. The generated password is displayed in an input field .
5. Users can copy the generated password to their clipboard by clicking on an icon.
